# This tool takes an 'sfnt' font collection, such as an OTC (OpenType/
# CFF Collection) or TTC (TrueType Collection), as its only command-
# line argument, then lists the number of fonts (as determined by the
# number of 'name' table instances), a listing of which tables are
# completely unshared, partially shared, and completely shared, along
# with a list of each table and the number of their instances, sorted
# from highest to lowest.

# Tool Dependencies: spot (AFDKO)
