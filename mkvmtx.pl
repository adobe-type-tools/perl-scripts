# This tool takes a CIDFont resource as its only command-line argument,
# along with a list of CIDs or CID ranges that correspond to full-width
# glyphs that rest on the Western baseline, such as Latin, Greek,
# Cyrillic, currency symbols, and other characters, as STDIN, and
# generates a 'vmtx' table override that can be included in a "features"
# file. The glyphs are mechanically centered along the Y-axis by using
# the top and bottom of the em-box as reference points, along with the
# top and bottom of their bounding boxes.

# Tool Dependencies: tx (AFDKO)
